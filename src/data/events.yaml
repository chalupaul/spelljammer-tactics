  name: Floating Dinhgy
  desc: As you arrive at the location, you see a small ship tied off at the surface. It's only big enough for one or two people to be aboard, but looks otherwise abandoned. Do you investigate the boat or pass on by?
    investigate: Roll 1 Int
      fail: You find two desecated corpses and dried waterskins near the boat in a small cavern. The boat's rudder was shot. There's no way they could have made it off this rock. You wonder how they got here in the first place. Is someone missing them?
      success: You encounter a cast-away frantically trying to get your help. He says he's been here for almost a week, and is running out of air and water! He's hidden what little he has in a cave nearby, that you're more than welcome to if you take him along. Gain 1 magic item and 2 chunks and Crewman Nel.
      crit: You encounter a second cast-away in the cave! Her name is Crewman Shel.
